# [FLOAT the GOAT event for SXSW16]
Shout-out to the creator of the template I used for Bootstrap to design this site. I totally revamped the whole thing however and made it my own. In fact the whole thing is custom from what I have learned over the last 6 months. 


Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
