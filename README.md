# [FLOAT the GOAT event for SXSW16]
Shout-out to the creator of the template I used for Bootstrap to design this site. I totally revamped the whole thing however and made it my own. In fact the whole thing is custom from what I have learned over the last 6 months. 

## Creator

Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/).
